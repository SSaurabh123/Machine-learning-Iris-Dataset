In this project IRIS Dataset is used to analyze and predict the type of flowers

In this project Shiny Application(IrisvisualUsingShiny folder) is also build to show the relationship between different flowers(their sepals and petals length and width)

Different Machine learning algorithm are used to predict type of flowers which are presented in the file MachinelearningIris.R 

In this project data is visualized using R programming language also and the visualization code is presented in VisualizationIris.R
